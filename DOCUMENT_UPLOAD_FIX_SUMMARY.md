# Document Upload Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

Your Flutter app's `content_library_service.dart` was unable to upload documents (DOCX, PDF, etc.) because:

1. **Wrong API endpoints**: Service was calling `/content-blocks/*` but backend uses `/content/*`
2. **Missing upload functionality**: No methods to handle file uploads
3. **No Cloudinary integration**: Backend supports Cloudinary uploads but service didn't use it

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Files

#### `frontend_flutter/lib/services/content_library_service.dart` ✅
- **Corrected all API endpoints** from `/content-blocks` to `/content`
- **Added file upload methods**:
  - `uploadDocument()` - Upload DOCX, PDF, etc. to Cloudinary
  - `uploadImage()` - Upload images to Cloudinary
  - `uploadAndCreateContent()` - One-step upload + create content block
- **Enhanced CRUD operations**:
  - Proper create/update/delete methods
  - Support for categories, folders, parent IDs
  - Support for Cloudinary public_id references

#### `frontend_flutter/lib/widgets/document_upload_widget.dart` ✅ (NEW)
- **DocumentUploadWidget**: Full-featured upload card with status
- **DocumentUploadButton**: Simple button for quick uploads
- Both include:
  - File picker integration
  - Upload progress indicators
  - Success/error handling
  - Callbacks for parent widgets

### 2. Documentation Created

## How It Works

### Upload Flow

```
1. User clicks upload button
   ↓
2. FilePicker opens → User selects file
   ↓
3. File bytes loaded into memory
   ↓
4. uploadAndCreateContent() called
   ↓
5. File uploaded to Cloudinary (POST /upload/template)
   ↓
6. Cloudinary returns URL and public_id
   ↓
7. Content block created in database (POST /content)
   ↓
8. Success callback triggered
   ↓
9. UI refreshes to show new document
```

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/content` | List all content blocks |
| GET | `/content?category=X` | Filter by category |
| POST | `/content` | Create content block |
| PUT | `/content/{id}` | Update content block |
| DELETE | `/content/{id}` | Delete content block |
| POST | `/upload/template` | Upload document to Cloudinary |
| POST | `/upload/image` | Upload image to Cloudinary |

## Quick Start

### 1. Use the Upload Button (Simplest)

```dart
import 'widgets/document_upload_widget.dart';

// In your widget tree:
DocumentUploadButton(
  buttonText: 'Upload Document',
  category: 'Company Documents',
  onUploadComplete: (result) {
    print('Uploaded: ${result['url']}');
  },
)
```

### 2. Use the Upload Card (More Features)

```dart
import 'widgets/document_upload_widget.dart';

// In your widget tree:
DocumentUploadWidget(
  category: 'Documents',
  onUploadComplete: (result) {
    setState(() {
      // Refresh your document list
    });
  },
)
```

### 3. Custom Implementation

```dart
import 'package:file_picker/file_picker.dart';
import 'services/content_library_service.dart';

final service = ContentLibraryService();

// Pick and upload
final result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
  type: FileType.custom,
  allowedExtensions: ['pdf', 'doc', 'docx'],
  withData: true,
);

if (result != null && result.files.first.bytes != null) {
  final file = result.files.first;
  final uploadResult = await service.uploadAndCreateContent(
    fileBytes: file.bytes!,
    fileName: file.name,
    label: file.name,
    category: 'Documents',
  );
  
  if (uploadResult?['success'] == true) {
    print('Success! URL: ${uploadResult['url']}');
  }
}
```

## Testing

Run the test page to verify everything works:

1. Create `lib/pages/test_upload_page.dart` (see `test_document_upload.md`)
2. Add route to your app
3. Navigate to test page
4. Upload a document
5. Verify it appears in the list

## Backend Requirements

Your backend already supports this! No changes needed.

### Required Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` has:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dhy0jccgg
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=357939367254897
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=Oic4eQR38JDVRDXd8nI7UkB8C1Y
```

✅ These are already configured in your `.env` file!

## Dependencies Required

All dependencies are already in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.2.2          # ✅ Already installed
  file_picker: ^6.1.1   # ✅ Already installed
```

No additional packages needed!

## Troubleshooting

### Upload fails
- ✅ Check backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- ✅ Verify Cloudinary credentials
- ✅ Check browser console for CORS errors

### Documents don't appear
- ✅ Verify category name matches
- ✅ Refresh the document list
- ✅ Check backend database

### File picker doesn't work
- ✅ Ensure `withData: true` is set
- ✅ For web, this is required to load file bytes

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation**
   - Use the test page in `test_document_upload.md`
   - Verify uploads work end-to-end

2. **Integrate into your app**
   - Add upload widgets to your content library pages
   - Use examples from `DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`

3. **Enhance functionality**
   - Add file preview
   - Add drag-and-drop upload
   - Add bulk upload
   - Add file validation (size, type)

4. **Production considerations**
   - Add authentication to upload endpoints
   - Implement file size limits
   - Add virus scanning
   - Monitor Cloudinary usage/costs

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section in `DOCUMENT_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`
2. Review the testing guide in `test_document_upload.md`
3. Check backend logs for error details
4. Verify Cloudinary dashboard shows uploaded files
