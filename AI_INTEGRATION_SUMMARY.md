# AI Integration for Proposal & SOW Builder
## Khonology Hackathon Submission

---

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the AI-powered features added to the Proposal & SOW Builder application to meet the hackathon requirements, specifically addressing:

1. **Mandatory Requirement**: Use of an AI component to improve the solution
2. **Wildcard Challenge**: Compound Risk Gate - detect multiple small deviations and block release until resolved

---

## ü§ñ AI Features Implemented

### 1. **AI-Powered Risk Analysis** (Wildcard Challenge Solution)

**Purpose**: Automatically detect compound risks across multiple proposal sections

**Capabilities**:
- Analyzes all proposal sections for completeness and quality
- Detects missing mandatory sections (Executive Summary, Scope, Deliverables, etc.)
- Identifies vague or unclear content (e.g., "various", "etc.", "and other")
- Flags incomplete team bios, missing assumptions, or altered clauses
- **Compound Risk Detection**: Aggregates multiple small issues into an overall risk score
- **Release Gate**: Blocks proposal release if risk score exceeds threshold

**API Endpoint**: `POST /ai/analyze-risks`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "proposal_id": "prop-123"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "overall_risk_level": "high",
    "can_release": false,
    "risk_score": 75,
    "issues": [
      {
        "category": "incomplete_content",
        "severity": "high",
        "section": "Scope & Deliverables",
        "description": "Scope contains vague language like 'various' and 'other stuff'",

    ]
  }
}
```

- Uses client/project context to create relevant, customized content
- Supports all proposal sections:
  - Executive Summary
  - Scope & Deliverables
  - Delivery Approach
  - Assumptions
  - Risks & Mitigation
  - Company Profile

**API Endpoint**: `POST /ai/generate-section`

**Request**:

- Provides specific, prioritized improvement suggestions
- Returns an improved version of the content
- Checks for professional tone, clarity, and completeness

**API Endpoint**: `POST /ai/improve-content`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "content": "We will do the project. It will be good.",
  "section_type": "executive_summary"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "improvements": {
    "quality_score": 15,
    "strengths": [
      "Brief and concise",
      "Simple sentence structure"
    ],

## üìä Hackathon Requirements Coverage

### ‚úÖ Mandatory Requirement: AI Component

**Implementation**:
- 5 AI-powered features integrated throughout the application
- Uses state-of-the-art Claude 3.5 Sonnet model via OpenRouter
- AI improves proposal quality, reduces errors, and saves time
- Seamlessly integrated into existing workflow

**Business Value**:
- **Time Savings**: Auto-generate sections in seconds vs. hours
- **Quality Improvement**: AI detects issues humans might miss
- **Consistency**: Ensures all proposals meet standards
- **Risk Reduction**: Prevents incomplete/poor proposals from being released

---

### ‚úÖ Wildcard Challenge: Compound Risk Gate

**Implementation**:
- AI analyzes entire proposal for multiple small deviations
- Aggregates issues into overall risk score (0-100)
- Blocks release if risk score exceeds threshold
- Presents summary of all flagged issues for quick action

**Specific Detections**:
1. ‚ùå **Missing Assumptions** - Critical section empty
2. ‚ùå **Incomplete Bios** - Team member details insufficient
3. ‚ùå **Altered Clauses** - Terms & conditions modified
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Vague Scope** - Contains "various", "etc.", "and other"
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Aggressive Timeline** - Unrealistic delivery dates
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Risks** - No risk assessment provided
7. ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Inconsistent Branding** - Doesn't follow Khonology standards

**Compound Risk Logic**:
- Each issue has severity: critical (10 pts), high (7 pts), medium (5 pts), low (3 pts)
- Risk score = sum of all issue points
- Release gate:
  - 0-30: ‚úÖ Ready (can_release = true)
  - 31-60: ‚ö†Ô∏è At Risk (can_release = false, warnings shown)
  - 61-100: ‚ùå Blocked (can_release = false, must fix)

## üîß Installation & Setup

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies (already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify .env configuration
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY should be set

# Test AI service
python test_ai_service.py

```

---

## üìà Performance & Costs

### Response Times:
- Risk Analysis: 3-8 seconds
- Content Generation: 2-5 seconds
- Content Improvement: 3-6 seconds
- Compliance Check: 2-4 seconds

### API Costs (OpenRouter):
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$3 per 1M input tokens, ~$15 per 1M output tokens
- Average proposal analysis: ~2,000 tokens = $0.03-0.05
- Estimated cost per proposal: **$0.10-0.20**

### Optimization Strategies:
1. **Caching**: Store AI analysis results for 1 hour
2. **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple proposals together
3. **Model Selection**: Use cheaper models for simple tasks
4. **Rate Limiting**: Limit AI calls per user/proposal

---

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
   - Backend-mediated calls (never exposed to frontend)
   - Environment variables in production

2. **Authentication**:
   - All AI endpoints require JWT authentication
   - User-specific rate limiting
   - Audit logging of AI usage

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Proposal data sent to OpenRouter (review their privacy policy)
   - Consider on-premise AI models for sensitive data
   - Implement data anonymization if needed

---

## üéì Future Enhancements

1. **AI Learning**:
   - Train on historical successful proposals
   - Learn company-specific terminology
   - Improve recommendations over time

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - AI-powered pricing suggestions
   - Competitive analysis
   - Win probability prediction
   - Auto-generate entire proposals from brief

3. **Integration**:
   - Connect to CRM for client data
   - Integrate with project management tools
   - Auto-populate from previous proposals

4. **Multi-language Support**:
   - Generate proposals in multiple languages
   - Translate existing proposals
