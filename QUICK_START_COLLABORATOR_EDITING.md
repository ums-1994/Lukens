# âœ… Collaborators Now Have Full Editing Rights!

## What's New

Collaborators can now **edit proposals** - not just view and comment!

## How to Use

### 1. **Invite a Collaborator** (with edit rights)

```
1. Open your proposal in the document editor
2. Click the collaboration button (ðŸ‘¥ icon in top toolbar)
3. Enter collaborator's email
4. Select permission: "Can Edit" (this is now the default!)
5. Click "Invite"
```

### 2. **Collaborator Receives Email**

They get an email with a secure collaboration link.

### 3. **Collaborator Clicks Link**

**What happens automatically:**
- System detects permission level = 'edit'
- Creates temporary user account (role: 'collaborator')
- Generates auth token (7-day validity)
- Opens FULL document editor
- Collaborator can edit, save, and collaborate!

## Permission Levels

When inviting, you can choose:

| Permission | What They Can Do |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **âœ“ Can Edit** (default) | Full editing access |
| Can Comment | View + comment only |

âœ… Edit all sections
âœ… Add/delete sections  
âœ… Format text
âœ… Upload images
âœ… Save changes
