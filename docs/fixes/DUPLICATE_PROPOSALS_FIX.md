# 🐛 Duplicate Proposals Bug - FIXED

## 📊 What Was Wrong

**Problem:** Every auto-save was creating a **NEW proposal** instead of updating the existing one.

**Root Cause:** HTTP status code mismatch
- Backend returns **201** (Created) when creating a new proposal
- Frontend was only checking for **200** (OK)
- This meant `createProposal()` always returned `null`
- Since the proposal ID was never saved, every auto-save thought it was a new document

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Fixed API Service** (`api_service.dart`)
Updated to accept both status codes:
```dart
// Before
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  return json.decode(response.body);
}

// After
if (response.statusCode == 200 || response.statusCode == 201) {
  return json.decode(response.body);
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging** (`blank_document_editor_page.dart`)
Added detailed console logging to track:
- When proposals are created vs updated
- What the proposal ID is
- Whether the ID is being saved correctly

### 3. **Fixed for SOWs Too**
Applied the same fix to `createSow()` to prevent the same issue there.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **First Auto-Save:**
1. User types in editor
2. After 3 seconds of inactivity → auto-save triggers
3. Calls `createProposal` (since `_savedProposalId` is null)
4. ✅ Backend returns 201 with proposal ID
5. ✅ Frontend now accepts 201 and saves the ID
6. 💾 `_savedProposalId` is set

### **Subsequent Auto-Saves:**
1. More typing → auto-save triggers again
2. Calls `updateProposal` (since `_savedProposalId` is NOT null)
3. ✅ Updates the SAME proposal
4. ✅ No duplicates!

## 🧹 Clean Up Existing Duplicates

You currently have **3 duplicate proposals**. Here's how to clean them up:

### Option 1: Delete via UI
1. Go to Proposals page
2. Click the trash icon on the 2 older proposals
3. Keep the newest one

### Option 2: Delete via Backend (if needed)
```bash
cd backend
python -c "
from app import get_db_connection
with get_db_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # List all proposals
    cursor.execute('SELECT id, title, created_at FROM proposals ORDER BY created_at')
    for row in cursor.fetchall():
        print(f'ID: {row[0]}, Title: {row[1]}, Created: {row[2]}')
"
```

Then delete specific IDs:
```bash
python -c "
from app import get_db_connection
with get_db_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # Delete by ID (replace with actual IDs)
    cursor.execute('DELETE FROM proposals WHERE id IN (1, 2)')
    conn.commit()
    print('Deleted duplicates')
"
```

## 🧪 Testing The Fix

**Test 1: Create New Document**
1. Open blank document editor
2. Type some content
3. Wait 3+ seconds
4. Check console: Should see "✅ Proposal created with ID: X"
5. Type more
6. Wait 3+ seconds  
7. Check console: Should see "🔄 Updating existing proposal ID: X"
8. Check Proposals page: Should see **only 1** proposal

**Test 2: Edit Existing Document**
1. Go to Proposals page
2. Click "Edit" on a proposal
3. Document loads with content ✅
4. Make changes
5. Auto-save triggers
6. Check console: Should see "🔄 Updating existing proposal ID: X"
7. Check Proposals page: Still **only 1** proposal (no duplicates)

## 📝 Console Output Examples

### Creating New Proposal:
```
📝 Creating new proposal...
🔍 Create proposal result: {id: 123, title: Untitled Document, ...}
✅ Proposal created with ID: 123
💾 Proposal ID saved in state - future saves will UPDATE this proposal
```

### Updating Existing Proposal:
```
🔄 Updating existing proposal ID: 123...
✅ Proposal updated: 123
🔍 Update result: {id: 123, title: My Document, ...}
```

## ✅ Verification

After the fix, you should see:
- ✅ Only **1 proposal** per document (no duplicates)
- ✅ Auto-save updates the same proposal
- ✅ Manual save updates the same proposal
- ✅ Versioning creates versions of the SAME proposal
- ✅ Comments attach to the SAME proposal
