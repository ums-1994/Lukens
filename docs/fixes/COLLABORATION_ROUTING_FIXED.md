# ✅ Collaboration Routing Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

The AuthWrapper was blocking unauthenticated access to the collaboration page. Now it properly detects collaboration URLs and bypasses authentication.

---

## 🔄 Apply the Fix

### In the terminal where Flutter is running, press:

**Option 1: Hot Restart (Recommended)**
```
Press 'R' (capital R) in the terminal
```

**Option 2: Stop and Restart**
```
Press 'q' to stop
Then run: flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8081
```

---

## ✅ Test It

1. Wait for Flutter to reload (5-10 seconds)
2. Click the collaboration link from your email again
3. **Should now show:** Guest Collaboration Page with the proposal! 🎉

---

## 🎯 What You Should See

When you click the collaboration link:

✅ URL: `localhost:8081/#/collaborate?token=...`  
✅ Page: Guest Collaboration Page  
✅ Content: Proposal title and content  
✅ Sidebar: Comments section  
✅ If you have "Can Comment" permission: Comment input box  

**No login required!** The guest can view and comment directly.

---

## 🐛 If It Still Shows Landing Page

1. Make sure Flutter fully restarted (look for "Performing hot restart...")
2. Try a full restart: Press 'q', then run again
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Try the link in an incognito/private window

---

**The collaboration feature should now work perfectly!** 🚀
