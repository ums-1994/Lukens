# ✅ Token Extraction Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

The GuestCollaborationPage now properly extracts the token from Flutter web's hash-based URLs (`localhost:8081/#/collaborate?token=...`).

---

## 🔄 Apply the Fix

In your Flutter terminal, press:

```
R
```

(Capital R for hot restart)

Wait for:
```
Performing hot restart...
Restarted application in XXXms.
```

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. After Flutter restarts, click the collaboration link from your email again
2. **Open the browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. Look for debug messages:
   ```
   🔍 Full URL: http://localhost:8081/#/collaborate?token=...
   📍 Token from query params: null
   📍 Token from fragment: VBpnF8WdDVhB0d82lpk...
   ✅ Token extracted: VBpnF8WdDVhB0d82lpk...
   ```

4. The page should now load the proposal!

---

## ✅ What You Should See

**Instead of Error:**
- ❌ "No access token provided"

**You Should See:**
- ✅ Loading indicator
- ✅ Proposal title in header
- ✅ Proposal content on the left
- ✅ Comments sidebar on the right
- ✅ Your email displayed in the header
- ✅ Comment input box (if you have permission)

---

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

1. **Check the console** (F12) for debug messages
2. **Look at the URL** - it should be:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081/#/collaborate?token=LONG_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

3. If the URL is different, share it with me

4. **Try a full restart:**
   ```
   Press 'q' in Flutter terminal
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8081
   ```

---

**Press R now, then click the link!** 🚀
