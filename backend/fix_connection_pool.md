# Connection Pool Fixes Applied

## Changes Made:

### 1. Increased Pool Size
- Changed `maxconn` from 10 to 20 connections
- This allows more concurrent database operations

### 2. Added Context Manager
- Created `get_db_connection()` context manager
- Ensures connections are ALWAYS returned to the pool, even if exceptions occur
- Prevents connection leaks

### 3. Added Null Check
- Modified `release_pg_conn()` to check if conn is not None before releasing
- Prevents errors when trying to release None connections

## How to Use the Context Manager:

**OLD WAY (prone to leaks):**
```python
conn = _pg_conn()
try:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # ... do database work ...
    conn.commit()
finally:
    release_pg_conn(conn)
```

**NEW WAY (safe):**
```python
with get_db_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    # ... do database work ...
    conn.commit()
# Connection automatically released!
```

## Status:
✅ Connection pool created with 20 max connections
✅ Context manager added
✅ Null check added to release_pg_conn()
✅ init_pg_schema() already has proper cleanup
✅ register() already has proper cleanup with finally block

## Recommendation:
All database operations should gradually be migrated to use the `get_db_connection()` context manager for automatic cleanup.

## Testing:
After these changes, the connection pool should:
- Handle more concurrent users (up to 20)
- Properly release connections even when errors occur
- Not exhaust the pool during normal operations
