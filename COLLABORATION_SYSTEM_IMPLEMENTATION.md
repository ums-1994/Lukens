# ü§ù Advanced Collaboration System Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

This document describes the professional collaboration system now available in your Proposal Builder.

---

## üìä Permission Levels

Your system now supports **4 distinct permission levels**:

| Permission | Who Uses It | What They Can Do | Auth Token? |
|------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Edit** | BD, Admin | Full editing access | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Suggest** | Reviewers, Managers | Propose changes for approval | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Comment** | Internal Reviewers | View + add comments | ‚ùå No |
| **View** | Clients | View only (Client Portal) | ‚ùå No |

---

## üéØ Core Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Suggest Mode (Review Mode)
**Status: Backend Complete ‚úÖ | Frontend Integration Needed üî®**

Reviewers can now propose changes without editing the document directly:

**Backend APIs:**
- `POST /api/proposals/{id}/suggestions` - Create a suggested change
- `GET /api/proposals/{id}/suggestions` - Get all suggestions for a proposal
- `POST /api/proposals/{id}/suggestions/{suggestion_id}/resolve` - Accept/reject suggestion

**Database:**
- New `suggested_changes` table tracks all suggested edits
- Stores original text, suggested text, status (pending/accepted/rejected)
- Records who suggested and who resolved

**How It Works:**
1. Reviewer with "suggest" permission opens proposal
2. They can select text and propose changes
3. Suggestions are stored in database with status "pending"
4. Proposal owner sees suggestions in a panel
5. Owner can Accept (apply change) or Reject (dismiss)
6. All suggestions are tracked with timestamps

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Soft Locking (Section-Level)
**Status: Backend Complete ‚úÖ | Frontend Integration Needed üî®**

Prevents editing conflicts by showing who is editing which section:

**Backend APIs:**
- `POST /api/proposals/{id}/sections/{section_id}/lock` - Lock a section
- `POST /api/proposals/{id}/sections/{section_id}/unlock` - Unlock a section
- `GET /api/proposals/{id}/sections/locks` - Get all active locks

**Database:**
- New `section_locks` table tracks active editing sessions
- Locks auto-expire after 5 minutes
- Users can see "John is editing this section" indicator

**How It Works:**
1. When user clicks on a section to edit, it locks automatically
2. Other users see indicator: "üîí Lebo is editing this section"
3. Lock expires after 5 minutes or when user navigates away
4. This is a **soft lock** - shows a warning but doesn't hard-block

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Section-Level Commenting
**Status: Backend Complete ‚úÖ | Frontend Integration Needed üî®**

Comments can now be attached to specific sections:

**Database Changes:**
- `document_comments` table now has `section_index` field
- `highlighted_text` field stores the text being commented on

**How It Works:**
1. User selects text in a section
2. Adds comment tied to that specific section
3. Comments appear inline or in sidebar next to that section
4. Can filter comments by section

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Collaboration Routing
**Status: Complete ‚úÖ**

Smart routing based on permission level:

```
Permission: edit ‚Üí Document Editor (full access)
Permission: suggest ‚Üí Document Editor (suggest mode)
Permission: comment ‚Üí Guest Collaboration Page
Permission: view ‚Üí Client Dashboard
```

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend_flutter/lib/pages/shared/collaboration_router.dart`
- Automatically detects permission and routes appropriately
- Sets correct auth tokens for edit/suggest modes

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Tables Created

```sql
-- Suggested Changes Table
CREATE TABLE suggested_changes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    proposal_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    section_id VARCHAR(255),
    suggested_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
    suggestion_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    original_text TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_by INTEGER,
    resolution_action VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (proposal_id) REFERENCES proposals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (suggested_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (resolved_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Section Locks Table
CREATE TABLE section_locks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    proposal_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    section_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    locked_by INTEGER NOT NULL,
    locked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (proposal_id) REFERENCES proposals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (locked_by) REFERENCES users(id),
    UNIQUE(proposal_id, section_id)
);
```

### Enhanced Tables

```sql
-- document_comments now supports section-level comments
ALTER TABLE document_comments ADD COLUMN section_index INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE document_comments ADD COLUMN highlighted_text TEXT;
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### Example 1: Reviewer Workflow

```
1. Reviewer receives email: "You've been invited to review proposal"
2. Clicks link ‚Üí Routes to Document Editor (suggest mode)
3. Reads through proposal, sees section needs changes
4. Selects text, clicks "Suggest Changes"
5. Enters suggested revision, submits
6. BD receives notification
7. BD reviews suggestion, clicks "Accept"
8. Change is automatically applied to document
9. Reviewer is notified: "Your suggestion was accepted"
```

### Example 2: Team Collaboration

```
1. BD creates proposal, invites:
   - Lebo (Edit permission) - helps write
   - Thabo (Suggest permission) - reviews content
   - Manager (Comment permission) - final approval
2. Lebo edits Scope section ‚Üí Auto-locks for 5 min
3. Thabo sees "üîí Lebo is editing Scope", waits
4. Thabo suggests change to Pricing ‚Üí Status: Pending
5. Manager adds comment: "Great work on risks section"
6. BD reviews all suggestions, accepts Thabo's pricing change
7. Manager approves proposal
```
