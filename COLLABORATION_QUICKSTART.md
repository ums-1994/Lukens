## 🎨 Frontend Integration (What's Next)

The backend is **fully functional**, but you still need to build the UI:

### Priority 1: Suggest Mode UI
**File:** `frontend_flutter/lib/pages/creator/blank_document_editor_page.dart`

Add a suggestions panel:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Document Editor       │ Suggestions│
│                        │             │
│  [Proposal Content]    │  📝 3 Pending│
│                        │             │
│                        │  Suggestion #1│
│                        │  Change "pricing"│
│                        │  to "cost"   │
│                        │  [Accept] [Reject]│
│                        │             │
│                        │  Suggestion #2│
│                        │  ...         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Priority 2: Section Lock Indicators
Show when someone else is editing:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Section 2: Scope of Work       │
│  🔒 Lebo is editing this section│
│  (Locked until 14:35)           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Priority 3: Activity Timeline Widget
Add to proposal sidebar:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Activity Timeline          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  10:30 AM - John commented  │
│  10:25 AM - Jane suggested  │
│  10:20 AM - You edited      │
│  10:15 AM - Proposal created│
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

---
