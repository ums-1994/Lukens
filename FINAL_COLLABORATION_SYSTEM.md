## 🎯 Feature #7: Diff View (Version Comparison)

### What It Does
Compare any two versions of a proposal to see exactly what changed.

### API Endpoint
```http
GET /api/proposals/{proposal_id}/versions/compare?version1=1&version2=2
```

### Response
```json
{
  "version1": {
    "version_number": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-10-28T10:00:00",
    "created_by": "John Doe"
  },
  "version2": {
    "version_number": 2,
    "created_at": "2025-10-28T14:30:00",
    "created_by": "Jane Smith"
  },
  "diff": "--- Version 1\n+++ Version 2\n@@ -15,7 +15,7 @@\n-Total: $50,000\n+Total: $45,000",
  "html_diff": "<table>...</table>",
  "changes": {
    "additions": 12,
    "deletions": 8,
    "modifications": 0
  }
}
```

### Features
- ✅ **Unified Diff** - Text-based diff output
- ✅ **HTML Diff** - Visual side-by-side comparison

## 🎯 Feature #8: @Mentions

### What It Does
Tag specific users in comments to get their attention and notify them immediately.

### How to Use
```
In any comment, type:
@john              → Mentions user "john"
@jane.smith        → Mentions user "jane.smith"
@reviewer@company.com  → Mentions by email
```

### What Happens
1. System extracts @mentions from comment
2. Finds mentioned users in database
3. Creates mention record
4. Sends notification to each mentioned user
5. Mentioned users see notification with link to comment

### API Endpoints
```http
GET /api/mentions
→ Get all mentions for current user

POST /api/mentions/{mention_id}/mark-read
→ Mark a mention as read
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "mentions": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "comment_id": 456,
      "comment_text": "Hey @john, can you review this pricing?",
      "mentioned_by_name": "Jane Smith",
      "mentioned_by_email": "jane@company.com",
      "proposal_title": "Cloud Migration Proposal",
      "proposal_id": 789,
      "section_index": 3,
      "created_at": "2025-10-28T14:30:00",
      "is_read": false
    }
  ],
  "unread_count": 5
}
```

### Features
- ✅ **Smart Detection** - Extracts @username or @email
- ✅ **Auto-Notification** - Mentioned users get instant alert
- ✅ **Read Tracking** - Mark mentions as read
- ✅ **Comment Linking** - Click to jump to comment
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - No double mentions
- ✅ **Self-Mention Prevention** - Can't mention yourself

### Database Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE comment_mentions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    comment_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    mentioned_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    mentioned_by_user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      future: _fetchDiff(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return TwoColumnDiff(
            leftVersion: snapshot.data.version1,
            rightVersion: snapshot.data.version2,
            changes: snapshot.data.changes,
