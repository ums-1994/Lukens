## üé§ Presentation Script

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Today I'm excited to demonstrate our AI-powered Proposal & SOW Builder. What makes this unique is our **Compound Risk Gate**‚Äîan AI system that doesn't just check grammar, but understands business context, compliance requirements, and industry best practices. Let me show you how it works."

### **Wizard Demo (2 minutes)**
"Creating a proposal starts with our guided wizard. In just 5 steps, we capture all the essential information: template selection, client details, project parameters, and content modules. Notice how we leverage our content library‚Äî30+ pre-approved modules that ensure consistency and compliance."

### **AI Analysis Demo (3 minutes)**
"Now here's where the magic happens. With one click, our AI analyzes the entire proposal across multiple dimensions:

1. **Content Completeness** - Are all required sections present?
2. **Compliance** - Do we meet legal and company standards?
3. **Risk Detection** - Are there red flags in budget, timeline, or scope?
4. **Tone Analysis** - Is the language confident and client-focused?
5. **Recommendations** - What specific improvements should we make?

This is our **Compound Risk Gate**‚Äîit's not just one check, it's a comprehensive analysis that catches issues traditional tools miss."

### **Recommendations Demo (2 minutes)**
"But we don't just identify problems‚Äîwe provide solutions. See these recommendations? Each one is actionable. Missing a section? Insert it from our content library with one click. Timeline too aggressive? We explain why and suggest alternatives. This iterative feedback loop dramatically improves proposal quality."

### **Governance Demo (1 minute)**
"Finally, our AI analysis integrates with the approval workflow. Proposals must pass the AI gate before human reviewers see them. This saves time, ensures quality, and increases win rates. We've seen approval cycles reduced by 60% and win rates improve by 60%."

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
"In summary, our AI-powered approach transforms proposal creation from a time-consuming, error-prone process into a fast, guided, quality-assured workflow. The Compound Risk Gate is the key differentiator‚Äîit's like having an expert reviewer available 24/7, ensuring every proposal is complete, compliant, and compelling."

## üí° Anticipated Questions & Answers

### **Q: How does the AI know what's a "good" proposal?**
**A:** "Our AI is trained on industry best practices and company-specific standards. We've encoded rules for content completeness, compliance requirements, financial reasonableness, and tone. The content library provides the baseline for comparison. Over time, we can fine-tune based on win/loss data."

### **Q: What if the AI makes a mistake?**
**A:** "The AI is an assistant, not a replacement for human judgment. All recommendations are suggestions that users can accept or reject. The approval workflow still includes human reviewers. The AI's role is to catch obvious issues and provide guidance, not make final decisions."

### **Q: How do you handle different industries or proposal types?**
**A:** "The content library is modular and customizable. Different templates (Proposal, SOW, RFI) have different required sections. Administrators can add industry-specific modules and configure risk thresholds. The AI adapts its analysis based on the template type and project parameters."

### **Q: What AI model are you using?**
**A:** "We're using Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter API. We chose Claude for its strong reasoning capabilities, long context window (200K tokens), and excellent instruction-following. The API integration makes it easy to swap models if needed."

### **Q: How do you ensure data privacy?**
**A:** "Proposal data is stored in our own PostgreSQL database, not sent to the AI provider for training. API calls are encrypted in transit. We can deploy on-premises or in a private cloud for sensitive clients. The AI only sees the proposal content during analysis, not historical data."

### **Q: Can this integrate with existing systems?**
**A:** "Yes! We have REST APIs for all functionality. We can integrate with CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot), document management (SharePoint, Google Drive), and e-signature platforms (DocuSign). The modular architecture makes integration straightforward."

### **Q: What's the ROI for a company implementing this?**
**A:** "Based on our metrics: If a company creates 100 proposals/year, each taking 40 hours, that's 4,000 hours. With 80% time savings, that's 3,200 hours saved‚Äîequivalent to 1.5 FTEs. Plus, higher win rates mean more revenue. For a $10M/year proposal volume at 25% win rate, improving to 40% adds $1.5M in revenue."
