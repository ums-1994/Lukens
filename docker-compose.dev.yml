# Development docker-compose to run a local Postgres for the backend.
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
# Notes:
# - The DB credentials below match the values in `backend/.env` so the app can connect locally.
# - For local runs you can set PGSSLMODE=disable (or edit backend/.env / create an .env.local) to avoid SSL errors.

  db:
    image: postgres:15

    ports:
      # Map container 5432 to a high host port to avoid conflicts with any local Postgres

volumes:
  unathi_pgdata:
    # Use a named volume so DB data persists between runs
    
# Optional: If you want the backend to run as a container as well, you can add a service
# that mounts the local source tree and runs the app. I left it out to keep this file
# simple; tell me if you want a backend service added that builds the `backend/Dockerfile`.
