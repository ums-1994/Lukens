```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Client Access Flow:

1. **Proposal Approved by CEO**
   ```
   Backend automatically creates collaboration invitation
   → Generates secure access token
   → Sends email with link: /#/collaborate?token=xyz
   ```

2. **Client Clicks Link**
   ```
   Flutter app detects /collaborate route
   → Extracts token from URL
   → Navigates to ClientDashboardHome
   ```

3. **Dashboard Loads**
   ```
   Calls /api/client/proposals?token=xyz
   → Fetches all proposals for client email
   → Displays dashboard with stats and table
   ```

4. **Client Clicks "View" on a Proposal**
   ```
   Opens ClientProposalViewer
   → Fetches full proposal details
   → Shows content, activity, comments tabs
   ```

5. **Client Takes Action**
   - **Approve:**
     ```
     Opens SignatureDialog
     → Client enters name, title, comments
     → Agrees to terms
     → Submits approval
     → Status updated to "Client Approved"
     → Redirected to dashboard
     ```
   
   - **Reject:**
     ```
     Opens RejectDialog
     → Client enters rejection reason
     → Submits rejection
     → Status updated to "Client Declined"
     → Redirected to dashboard
     ```
