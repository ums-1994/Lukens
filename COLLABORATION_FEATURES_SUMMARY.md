## üé® Frontend Work Needed

### Priority 1: Suggestions Panel
Add to `blank_document_editor_page.dart`:

```dart
// Right sidebar showing pending suggestions
class SuggestionsPanel extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      width: 300,
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Text('Pending Suggestions (3)'),
          // List of suggestions
          SuggestionCard(
            originalText: "...",
            suggestedText: "...",
            suggestedBy: "John Doe",
            onAccept: () => _acceptSuggestion(),
            onReject: () => _rejectSuggestion(),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Priority 2: Notification Bell
Add to app bar:

```dart
IconButton(
  icon: Badge(
    label: Text('3'),
    child: Icon(Icons.notifications),
  ),
  onPressed: () => _showNotifications(),
)
```

### Priority 3: Activity Timeline
Add to proposal details:

```dart
ActivityTimeline(
  activities: activities,
  // Shows chronological feed
)
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Test all APIs with Postman
2. Build suggestions UI panel in Flutter
3. Add notification bell icon
4. Implement activity timeline widget

**Phase 2:**
5. Add diff view for version comparison
6. Implement @mention functionality
7. Add real-time WebSocket updates

**Phase 3 (Optional AI):**
8. AI summarize reviewer comments
