# ‚úÖ Fixed: Collaborator vs Client Routing

## Problem
When inviting a **collaborator** to review a proposal, they were shown the **Client Dashboard** instead of the **Guest Collaboration Page**.

## Solution
Created a smart router (`CollaborationRouter`) that automatically detects the invitation type and routes to the correct page:

### How It Works:
1. User clicks collaboration link with token
2. Router calls `/api/collaborate` endpoint
3. Checks the `permission_level`:
   - **`comment`** ‚Üí Shows **Guest Collaboration Page** (for collaborators)
   - **`view`** ‚Üí Shows **Client Dashboard** (for clients)

## What Changed:

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `frontend_flutter/lib/main.dart` - Updated routing to use CollaborationRouter
- ‚úÖ `frontend_flutter/lib/pages/shared/collaboration_router.dart` - NEW smart router component

**No Backend Changes Needed** - Uses existing `permission_level` in collaboration invitations.

## Testing:

### For Collaborators:
1. Invite someone to collaborate on a proposal
2. They click the link
3. **Result:** See Guest Collaboration Page ‚úì

### For Clients:
1. Approve a proposal to send to client
2. Client clicks the email link
3. **Result:** See Client Dashboard ‚úì

## Debug Logs:
Check browser console (F12) for routing decisions:
```
‚úÖ Token found, determining collaboration type...
üîç Checking collaboration type for token: abc...
‚Üí Routing to Guest Collaboration Page (collaborator)
```

Or:
```
‚úÖ Token found, determining collaboration type...
üîç Checking collaboration type for token: xyz...
‚Üí Routing to Client Dashboard (view-only)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**  
**Test:** Invite a collaborator now - they should see the Guest Collaboration Page!
