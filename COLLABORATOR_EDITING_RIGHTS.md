# ✅ Collaborators Now Have Full Editing Rights

## What Changed

Collaborators can now **fully edit** proposals, not just view and comment!

## Permission Levels

The system now supports **three permission levels** when inviting collaborators:

| Permission | What They Can Do | UI Shown |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| **Can Edit** ⭐ | Full editing access - can modify proposal content | Full Document Editor |
| **Can Comment** | View and add comments only | Guest Collaboration Page |
| **View Only** | Read-only access | Client Dashboard |

## How It Works

### 1. **Inviting a Collaborator with Edit Rights**

When you click the collaboration button in the document editor:

```
1. Dialog opens
2. Enter collaborator email
3. Select permission: "Can Edit" (default) ✓
4. Click "Invite"
5. Collaborator receives email with secure link
```

### 2. **Collaborator Access Flow**

```
Collaborator clicks link
    ↓
System checks permission level = 'edit'
    ↓
Backend creates temporary user account
    ↓
Generates auth token automatically
    ↓
Opens FULL Document Editor (not read-only)
    ↓
Collaborator can edit, save, add sections, etc.
```

### 3. **Backend Smart Authentication**

When a collaborator with 'edit' permission accesses:

```python
# Backend automatically:
1. Creates guest user account: role = 'collaborator'
2. Generates temporary auth token (7-day validity)
3. Returns auth token to frontend
4. Frontend stores token in AuthService
5. Document editor uses this token for API calls
```

## Updated Invitation Dialog

The dropdown now shows:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Can Edit          │ ← Default for collaborators
│   Can Comment       │
│   View Only         │
└─────────────────────┘
```
