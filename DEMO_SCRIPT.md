## 📝 Full Script with Actions

### **[0:00 - 0:30] OPENING - Slide 1**

**SAY:**
> "Good morning/afternoon! I'm [Your Name], and today I'm excited to present our AI-Powered Proposal & SOW Builder. This solution addresses a critical business challenge: creating high-quality proposals quickly and consistently. What makes our approach unique is the **Compound Risk Gate**—an AI system that doesn't just check grammar, but understands business context, compliance, and industry best practices. Let me show you how it transforms proposal creation."

**DO:**
- Stand confidently
- Make eye contact
- Smile
- Advance to Slide 2

---

### **[0:30 - 1:15] THE PROBLEM - Slide 2**

**SAY:**
> "Let's start with the problem. Companies today struggle with proposal creation. On average, it takes **40 hours** to create a single proposal. That proposal goes through **3 to 4 revision rounds**, and despite all that effort, **30% still have compliance issues**. The approval cycle takes **5 to 7 days**, and ultimately, the win rate is only **25%**. This means companies are spending enormous resources on proposals that often don't win. There has to be a better way."

**DO:**
- Point to each metric as you mention it
- Pause after "25% win rate" for emphasis
- Show concern/frustration in tone
- Advance to Slide 3

---

### **[1:15 - 2:00] THE SOLUTION - Slide 3**

**SAY:**
> "Our solution combines three powerful components. First, a **guided wizard** that simplifies the creation process into 5 easy steps. Second, a **content library** with over 30 pre-approved modules that ensure consistency and compliance. And third, our **AI Analysis engine**—the Compound Risk Gate—that guarantees quality before proposals go to reviewers. This isn't just automation; it's intelligent assistance that makes everyone more effective. Let me explain what makes the Compound Risk Gate special."

**DO:**
- Point to each component in the diagram
- Emphasize "Compound Risk Gate"
- Build excitement in your voice
- Advance to Slide 4

### **[2:00 - 3:00] COMPOUND RISK GATE - Slide 4**

**SAY:**
> "The Compound Risk Gate is our key innovation. Unlike traditional tools that only check spelling and grammar, our AI analyzes **six dimensions simultaneously**:

> 1. **Content Completeness** - Are all required sections present?
> 2. **Compliance** - Do we meet legal and company standards?
> 3. **Financial Analysis** - Is the budget reasonable for this project type?
> 4. **Timeline Feasibility** - Is the schedule realistic?
> 5. **Tone and Sentiment** - Is the language confident and client-focused?
> 6. **Industry Benchmarks** - How does this compare to similar projects?

> This multi-dimensional analysis catches issues that humans often miss, especially under time pressure. It's like having an expert reviewer available 24/7. Now, let me show you how this works in practice."

**DO:**
- Count on fingers as you list dimensions
- Emphasize "six dimensions simultaneously"

> "And here are the results. Let me walk you through what the AI found."

**ACTION 12: Point to each section as you explain**

**SAY:**
> "**Overall Score: 85 out of 100.** That's good, but there's room for improvement.

> **Risks Detected:** The AI has identified several issues:
> - **High Risk** (red): Missing 'Assumptions & Risks' section. This is required for compliance.
> - **Medium Risk** (yellow): The budget of $500K is higher than typical for this project type. We need justification.
> - **Low Risk** (blue): Consider adding client references for credibility.

> **Content Completeness:** The AI checked all required modules. Company Profile, Executive Summary, and Terms are present. But Assumptions & Risks is missing—that's a compliance issue.

> **Compliance Checks:** Standard terms are included, but the payment terms differ from company standard. This will need approval justification.

> **Recommendations:** Here's where it gets powerful. The AI doesn't just identify problems—it tells us exactly how to fix them."

**ACTION 13: Scroll through recommendations**

**SAY:**
> "Look at this first recommendation: 'Add Assumptions & Risks section.' There's a button right here that says 'Insert from Library.' Watch this."

**ACTION 14: Click "Insert from Library" button (if available) or explain**

**SAY:**
> "One click, and the AI pulls the pre-approved content from our library and inserts it into the proposal. Let me re-run the analysis to show the improvement."

**ACTION 15: Click "Analyze with AI" again**

**SAY:**
> "Now the score has improved from 85 to 92. The high-risk issue is resolved. This iterative feedback loop is what makes the system so powerful. Creators learn best practices in real-time and produce better proposals faster."

**DO:**
- Show the improved score
- Emphasize the score change
- Advance to Slide 7 (or continue in app)

### **[6:30 - 7:30] DEMO PART 3: RECOMMENDATIONS - Slide 7**

**SAY:**
> "Let me show you the before and after more clearly."

**DO:**
- Switch to Slide 7 if not already there

**SAY:**
> "Before applying AI recommendations, we had a score of 85, missing critical sections, and 3 high-risk issues. After applying the recommendations—adding the missing section, justifying the budget, and including case studies—the score improved to 92, all required sections are complete, and we have zero high-risk issues.

> This is the power of the Compound Risk Gate. It's not just analysis—it's actionable guidance that improves quality in real-time. And because the recommendations are one-click actions, the revision process is fast. What used to take 3-4 revision rounds now takes 1-2."

**DO:**
- Point to the before/after comparison
- Emphasize "zero high-risk issues"
- Advance to Slide 8

---

### **[7:30 - 8:15] IMPACT METRICS - Slide 8**

**SAY:**
> "So what's the impact? Let me show you the numbers.

> **Creation Time:** Reduced from 40 hours to 8 hours—that's an **80% reduction**.

> **Approval Cycle:** Down from 5-7 days to 2-3 days—a **60% reduction**. Why? Because the AI pre-screens for quality, so reviewers spend less time on basic issues.

> **Revision Rounds:** Cut in half, from 3-4 rounds to 1-2 rounds.

> **Compliance Issues:** Dropped from 30% to just 5%—an **83% reduction**. This is huge for legal risk.

> **Win Rate:** Improved from 25% to 40%—a **60% increase**. Better proposals win more business.

> Let me put this in perspective. If a company creates 100 proposals per year, and each one saves 32 hours, that's **3,200 hours saved**—equivalent to 1.5 full-time employees. And if their proposal volume is $10 million per year, improving the win rate from 25% to 40% adds **$1.5 million in revenue**. The ROI is clear and measurable."

**DO:**
- Point to each metric as you mention it
- Emphasize the dollar amounts
- Pause after "$1.5 million in revenue"
- Advance to Slide 9

## ❓ Q&A Preparation

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How does the AI know what's a good proposal?"**
**A:** "Great question. The AI is trained on industry best practices and company-specific standards. We've encoded rules for content completeness, compliance requirements, and financial reasonableness. The content library provides the baseline for comparison. Over time, we can fine-tune based on win/loss data to make it even smarter."

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
**A:** "The AI is an assistant, not a replacement for human judgment. All recommendations are suggestions that users can accept or reject. The approval workflow still includes human reviewers—legal, finance, and management. The AI's role is to catch obvious issues and provide guidance, saving reviewers time for strategic decisions."

**Q: "How do you handle different industries?"**
**A:** "The content library is modular and customizable. Administrators can add industry-specific modules and configure risk thresholds. Different templates—Proposal, SOW, RFI—have different required sections. The AI adapts its analysis based on the template type and project parameters."

**Q: "What's the cost of the AI API?"**
**A:** "We use Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter, which costs approximately $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. For a typical proposal analysis of 10,000 tokens, that's about $0.15 per analysis. Given the time savings and improved win rates, the ROI is extremely favorable."

**Q: "Can this integrate with our existing systems?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. We have REST APIs for all functionality. We can integrate with CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot, document management like SharePoint or Google Drive, and e-signature platforms like DocuSign. The modular architecture makes integration straightforward."

**Q: "How long did this take to build?"**
**A:** "The core functionality was built over [X weeks/months], with iterative improvements based on testing. The AI integration was particularly interesting—we experimented with different prompts and analysis strategies to get the best results. The content library took time to populate with quality modules, but now it's a powerful asset."

**Q: "What's next for this project?"**
**A:** "We have several exciting enhancements planned: predictive win probability scoring based on historical data, competitor analysis integration, multi-language support for global teams, and deeper CRM integration. We're also exploring using the AI to generate first drafts, not just analyze existing content."
